Managers usually have to manage approvals out of a number of systems causing delays in approval actions and excessive context switching. Also, the large volumes of email notifications from these systems cause important approval notifications to sometimes get missed.

The “My Approvals Hub” is a Teams application developed to aggregate approvals from the identified outsides systems, for now just implemented for Service Now, providing a list of approvals pending and the option for each manager to approve or reject the item.
